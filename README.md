Currently I work in the commercial area for a software consultancy specialized in business management systems (ERP).

Programmed in Python, C #, Java (desktop and android) and HTML + CSS + Javascript. I have experience with different frameworks like Flask, Bootstrap or Selenium, and I am also learning about cybersecurity.

Right now I'm looking for programming projects where I can apply what I learned years ago.

If you want to contact me, do not hesitate, send me an email and I will be happy to talk to you.
