I am currently working as a developer and IT service for a manufacturing company.

Before that, I was working as technical assistance and commercial area for a software consultancy specialized in business management systems (ERP).

Programmed in Python, C #, WebDev (PC-Soft), Flutter and Web (HTML + CSS + Javascript). I have experience with different frameworks like Flask, Bootstrap or Selenium, and I am also learning about cybersecurity.
